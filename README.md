# reward-chart-generator

## Synopsis

The **Reward Chart Generator** is a simple web app can generate custom reward charts meant for tracking daily progress on a goal. 

The user inputs include:
* number of days
* days marked as milestones
* chart heading and subheading

## Motivation

I wanted a simple reward chart for tracking progress on a reading curriculum I intended on using with my child. The reward chart would require milestones at irregular intervals. Instead of hunting down something that already existed, I decided to create a web app that would generate one that met my exact wants and needs. 

## Project Setup

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
